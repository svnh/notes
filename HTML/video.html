  <!--
    Formats:
      - browsers differ in what video formats they support
    Players / Plugins:
      - browsers were originally built to support only text and images
      - browsers built before 2010 need a plugin to be installed
      - players and plugins only support certain formats
      - HTML5 video tag replaces players / plugins
    Approach:
      - to ensure most users can access video content, use HTML5 video element and flash
      - use hosted services (Vimeo, Youtube)
