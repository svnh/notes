Measuring output
Supplementing curriculum
- Identifying areas that are challenging for students
- Use this to restructure or enhance content
- Tapout curriculum from Hack Reactor
- Involve instructors in process: where do they think there is a gap that should be filled

Analytics
- How are students interacting with content?
- Are students spending too long on a certain part of the curriculum?

Learning styles
- Assignments
- Scenario-based learning
- Come up with projects of your own
- Simulations

How do we balance teaching the technical stuff with allowing them to be creative

Tell them about a topic
- Ask students to do their own research on their own (online, talk to SWE)
- Interpret what you understand from what you've found
- Consolidation of knowledge, students teach each other and share ideas

Capture attention and ask to solve problems - Godzilla example
- Guide them on what they should be looking for

What are the red flags we should be looking out for?
- Be empathetic toward students and how they're progressing in the course
- Watch out in MP to make sure we're not doing away with students who might be a good fit: get to know your students, do 1.1 sessions, determine learning styles and challenges, svnh should meet with them bi-weekly

Maintain the human touch
- Stay connected with students
- Gather feedback and act on it

What is important data to collect?
- Student feedback on course, teaching style, content
- More specific is better
- Identify specific areas within course that need improvement/change/review
- Feedback on instructors
- Get more individualized information from students: where they are, where did they struggle, what will they do differently, how do they relate with certain content
- Understand our student population and what is effective for different types of students

Students expect us to be perfect already, how do we build buyin to giving feedback?
- Conversation-style, rather than forms
- You don't only want a standardized response to all of your concerns
- When you talk to someone you get their emotion, reaction (disappointment, passion)
- Create a relationship and safe place for students to criticize or appreciate us: they won't be failed for giving us feedback and it shows a higher type of thinking

Culture in Kenyan classrooms/employment is typically "follow the leader" with no space for questions
- It is not encouraged professionally or in education to give pushback
- We're going to learn whatever you want to tell us and move on
- Create space for dialog
