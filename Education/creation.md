Connection between courses

Curriculum creation/testing/feedback cycle
- build/test/learn

What does a student need to know?
What does tangible success look like in that?
What are the in-class and out of class experiences we can put together to help students reach a level of master?

Critical thinking, quantitative reasoning

Core skills
- Visualizing data

Learning outcomes per week or day (3-4)
- Student is able to...
- Student understands...
(tangible how/when)

What does success look like in terms of being able to do objective
5: Mastery of "choosing the right charts for a given set of data is" can do x,y,z effectively with less than 10% error
4: 20% error
3,2,1...

In class materials balanced with home-study: online + in-house
- Discovery: motivate + make interested in subject and aware of gaps in their understanding

Rubrics for facilitated sessions
- How well does design of session hit learning principles?
- How many students are active for how much of the time? (everyone should be engaging and active)
- Is it hitting the right learning outcome: ask participants "what did you think was the main objective of this session" "what is one new larning that you're leaving this session with"
- Most of sessions is done with live students, week to week during the course of the year
- Have someone observing session in-class
- Need to also test at home content: how do you test objectives learned not in the classroom

Come up with concept + run test with faculty
