Black Swan characteristics
- Rarity: it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility
- Extreme Impact: it carries an extreme impact
- Retrospective predictability: in spite of its outlier status human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable

Black Swan logic makes what you don't know far more relevant than what you do know. Consider that many Black Swans can be caused and exacerbated by their being unexpected.

Whatever your enemy knows that you know is inconsequential.

Misunderstaning of causal chains causes inpredictability

Platonicity: the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes. The Platonic fold is the explosive boundary where the Platonic mindset enters in contact with messy reality, where the gap between what you know and what you think you know becomes dangerously wide. It is here that the Black Swan is produced.

Arbitrariness of categories, absurdity of clustering.
