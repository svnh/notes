Characteristics
- Rarity: it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility
- Extreme Impact: it carries an extreme impact
- Retrospective predictability: in spite of its outlier status human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable

Black Swan logic makes what you don't know far more relevant than what you do know. Consider that many Black Swans can be caused and exacerbated by their being unexpected.

Whatever your enemy knows that you know is inconsequential.

Misunderstaning of causal chains causes inpredictability

Platonicity: the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes. The Platonic fold is the explosive boundary where the Platonic mindset enters in contact with messy reality, where the gap between what you know and what you think you know becomes dangerously wide. It is here that the Black Swan is produced.

Arbitrariness of categories, absurdity of clustering. Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity. Any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world.

Scalable vs Nonscalable
- In jobs where you have to be physically present (massage, restaurant, etc): Your revenue depends on your continuous efforts more than on the quality of your decisions. Moreover, this kind of work is largely predictable: it will vary, but not to the point of making the income of a single day more significant than that of the rest of your life. In other words, it will not be Black Swan driven.
- If you are an idea person, you do not have to work hard, only think intensely. You do the same work whether you produce a hundred units or a thousand.
- DNA: survival of the fittest, winner takes all

The American economy has leveraged itself heavily on the idea generation, which explains why losing manufacturing jobs can be coupled with a rising standard of living. Implementation (not innovation) is outsourced.

In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total. (successful authors, billionaires)

Mediocristan (subjected to what we call type 1 randomness): height, weight, calorie consumption, income for a baker, a small restaurant owner, a prostitute, or an orthodontist; gambling profits (in the very special case, assuming the person goes to a casino and maintains a constant betting size), car accidents, mortality rates, "IQ" (as measured).

Extremistan (subjected to what we call type 2 randomness): wealth, income, book sales per author, book citations per author, name recognition as a "celebrity," number of references on Google, populations of cities, uses of words in a vocabulary, numbers of speakers per language, damage caused by earthquakes, deaths in war, deaths from terrorist incidents, sizes of planets, sizes of companies, stock ownership, height between species (consider elephants and mice), financial markets (but your investment manager does not know it), commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data. The Extremistan list is much longer than the prior one.

How can we figure out properties of the (infinite) unknown based on the (finite) known?

From the standpoint of the turkey, the nonfeeding of the one thousand and first day is a Black Swan. For the butcher, it is not, since its occurrence is not unexpected. So you can see here that the Black Swan is a sucker's problem. In other words, it occurs relative to your expectation.
