-- Wisdoms

the most important skill a school can pass down to its students is the ability to motivate themselves

Traditional education traps and boxes students, doesnt' allow them to do self learning. No freedom.

Learning is a natural by-product of all human activity.[11] Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated

Education is neither a product nor a service. It calls for the student to engage and experience. Since it depends on participation, it cannot be consumed.

Encouragement: saying "wow", encouraging learning. Threatening, punishment and examinations, shut down the brain.

Learning is the product of educational self-organization. Don't 'make' it happen, let it happen.

Self organized learning environments: broadband + collaboration + encouragement

Curriculum of big, wonderous questions. Intellectual adventures driven by big questions.

All children are born artists, the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. We get 'educated' out of creativity as we grow up.

Actively seek out and listen to negative feedback - don't tell me what you like, tell me what you didn't like

Boil things down to the most fundamental truths. What are we sure is true? Reason up from there.
Example: "someone says battery packs are expensive and that's how they will always be. no, that's dumb. if you apply that reasoning to anything new, nothing new happens. historically it's costed $600kw/h and it's not going to be much better than that in the future.
What are the material constituants of the battery? What does each of them cost? Then you find that it's actually $80kw/h. All you have to do is take those materials and shape them into a battery.""
