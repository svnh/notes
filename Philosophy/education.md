What do our students care about: receiving, learning, in life?

What outcomes are essential?
- Getting a job
- Learning objectives
- Leadership

What is an instructor's role in the classroom?


--- Frank
Know your role in the classroom: guide, authority

Understand your audience: what is motivating them, what is their general sentiment
- use examples from their world to explain concepts to them
- have insight into who they are and what they care about before they come to class

Relationship with students: availability driven by genuine care

Create opportunitites for students to feel internal intrinsic motivation


--- Wisdoms
the most important skill a school can pass down to its students is the ability to motivate themselves

Traditional education traps and boxes students, doesnt' allow them to do self learning. No freedom.

Learning is a natural by-product of all human activity.[11] Learning is self-initiated and self-motivated

Education is neither a product nor a service. It calls for the student to engage and experience. Since it depends on participation, it cannot be consumed.

Encouragement: saying "wow", encouraging learning. Threatening, punishment and examinations, shut down the brain.

Learning is the product of educational self-organization. Don't 'make' it happen, let it happen.

Self organized learning environments: broadband + collaboration + encouragement

Curriculum of big, wonderous questions. Intellectual adventures driven by big questions.

All children are born artists, the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. We get 'educated' out of creativity as we grow up.

Actively seek out and listen to negative feedback - don't tell me what you like, tell me what you didn't like

Boil things down to the most fundamental truths. What are we sure is true? Reason up from there.
Example: "someone says battery packs are expensive and that's how they will always be. no, that's dumb. if you apply that reasoning to anything new, nothing new happens. historically it's costed $600kw/h and it's not going to be much better than that in the future.
What are the material constituants of the battery? What does each of them cost? Then you find that it's actually $80kw/h. All you have to do is take those materials and shape them into a battery.""

Capitalize on feeling of learning

Redefine success metrics


--- EDIO July (Nairobi)

Responsive "organic" learning structures

Teachers teach theory --> connecting the dots
Robot teach skills

People don't realize (?) and are afraid to admit that universities are flawed businesses

Innovators (teachers) need space to innovate
- The system doesn't allow failure and therefore stifles innovation

I feel like there is so much we can do with our new model!
The LMS - to track students effectively for more than their test scores
No teachers - wahoo! Cheap wahoo!

At the end of the day people just want proof

Assumptions of current model:
- You need teachers.
- 8-4-4
- 'Success' is correct.

Redefinition of success metrics

What parts of the current system do we need to work inside of?
- theory is important - gives a bigger scope of the work that we are doing
- unfortunately, need stupid certificates or some way to validate our work (perhaps need more time to prove the effectiveness of our course)
- knowledge can't be replaced with skills --> need knowledge to drive the skills

What structures need to exist for "safe" experimentation?

You need humans if you don't have technology
- How to maintain human element and get qualitative insights w/o teachers?



Tools for new model:
- Student dashboard accessible to parents/stakeholders (data-driven education)
- Parents/teacher/curriculum involvement
- Transparent, clear innovation on classroom/curriculum content/structure

Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education (also self-learning and self-teaching) is the act of learning about a subject or subjects in which one has had little to no formal education.


--- Finance

Universities are a business
College spending is currently a black box
Financial decision making is best guided through business model approaches that prioritize data transparency
Change is an ongoing purpose that must be purposeful
These new network-aware practices include shared governance, but expand upon it to distribute leadership and decision making more broadly throughout the organization with the goal of improving performance.

--- Student Tracking
-- HR

What would you keep with the current student tracking system?
- give and receive feedback to/from students
- peer data, students rate each other: what percent do you think each person contributed
- autonomy: take ownership of your own learning
- junior/senior whiteboarding

What do you want?
- self reporting: people tell us when they're struggling
- automated emails when students are failing via taser
- collect data from employers and alumni about job search process, preparedness by curriculum
- keep better pulse on industry demands

What is not working?
- whiteboarding curriculum: instead do live coding
- feedback loop between job seekers and what happens day to day

Dimensions of effective student tracking:
- Technical
- Ability to build rapport in classroom
- Accountability
- Confidence

Who does what
- Technical Mentor: grades assessments, 1:1 work with struggling students
- Counselor: group checkins, 1:1 emotional support in escalations, students exiting program
- Coordinator: daily ins and outs, pulse emotional and pairing informaiton, admin tasks


--- Workplace dynamics

Millennials expect accelerated responsibility and paths to leadership. “They seek greater purpose in their work. And they want greater flexibility in how that work is done[14].” This is affecting power relationships in the workplace, compounded by the information asymmetry in technologies. 78% of millennials are rated as highly tech savvy versus just 4% of Boomers.

We asked 136 Kenyan HR professionals the question “If you could help grow the staff in your company in a few key areas of personal competence, what would they be?” The results showed that their highest need is for staff to become more committed to the mission of the organisation and their part in it (See Table 1: average rating of 8.48, with a response count of 81). This finding indicates that training could be used to achieve organisational change objectives beyond that of skills development. High ratings were also given to Taking initiative (8.33), Owning responsibility for their jobs (8.28), and Handling stress and pressure better (8.21), all of which were rated substantially higher than Becoming more competent in their technical / functional area of expertise (7.01)
