Dominance: Creating Focal Points In Your Design

When you create dominance in your work you are creating elements that command attention and prevail over other elements.

Every design should have a primary area of interest or focal point that serves as a way into the design. From the primary dominant element, design flow can be achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance.

Dominance:
- Relies on contrast
- Is the varying degree of emphasis in your design elements
- Creates a visual hierarchy in your design: use dominance to create an entry point into your design as well as a hierarchy to help guide the eye from one part of your design to the next
- More visual weight = more dominance in the element

A lack of dominance:
- Between elements leads to competition between them
- Your readers must work to find their own entry point into your design. That’s not as easy as it seems and the least amount of work may be moving on to another design on another page on another site. Remember, “Don’t make me think.” Instead make it easy to find a way into your design.

3 levels of dominance in your work:
1. Dominant: The element given the most visual weight, the element of primary emphasis. The dominant element will advance into the foreground in your composition.
2. Sub-Dominant: The element(s) of secondary emphasis that will become the middle ground in your composition.
3. Subordinate: The elements with tertiary emphasis, given the least visual weight. Subordinate elements will recede into the background of your composition.

Visual weight can be added/removed to elements through a combination of:
- Size: As you would expect larger elements carry more weight
- Color: It’s not fully understood why, but some colors are perceived as weighing more than others. Red seems to be heaviest while yellow seems to be lightest.
- Density: Packing more elements into a given space, gives more weight to that space.
- Value: A darker object will have more weight than a lighter object.
- Whitespace: Positive space weighs more than negative space or whitespace.
