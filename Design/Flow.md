Flow is the way your eye moves or is led through a composition.

Two basic components
1. Verbal Flow - the path taken when reading text on the page
2. Visual Flow - the path taken when looking at images and graphics on the page

Good Flow
- Leads the eye, presenting information in the order you want it to be seen

Text
- Develop a consistent typographic style across your site – Be consistent with your use of font size, face, and color
- Choose a font for your copy that is easy to read – Your copy is not the place for a fancy font
- Remember the principle of proximity: place headings close to the text they refer to, captions close to images. Organize your text elements so it’s clear what goes with what
- Watch the width of columns: don’t make columns to wide or too narrow as each hinders reading
- Develop a vertical rhythm in your type: use consistent line heights and vertical margins and paddings
