### CRAP (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity)

Contrast: Items that are different should look different

Repetition: Some aspects of the design should be repeated across the entire design

Alignment: Nothing on a page should be placed arbitrarily, all elements should have a visual connection with something else on the page

Proximity: Related items should be grouped together


### Principles

Balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical
