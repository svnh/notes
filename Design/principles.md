### CRAP (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity)

Contrast: Items that are different should look different

Repetition: Some aspects of the design should be repeated across the entire design

Alignment: Nothing on a page should be placed arbitrarily, all elements should have a visual connection with something else on the page

Proximity: Related items should be grouped together


### Principles

Balance: symmetrical and asymmetrical

### Flow

Flow is the way your eye moves or is led through a composition.

Two basic components
1. Verbal Flow - the path taken when reading text on the page
2. Visual Flow - the path taken when looking at images and graphics on the page

Good Flow
- Leads the eye, presenting information in the order you want it to be seen

Text
- Develop a consistent typographic style across your site – Be consistent with your use of font size, face, and color
- Choose a font for your copy that is easy to read – Your copy is not the place for a fancy font
- Remember the principle of proximity: place headings close to the text they refer to, captions close to images. Organize your text elements so it’s clear what goes with what
- Watch the width of columns: don’t make columns to wide or too narrow as each hinders reading
- Develop a vertical rhythm in your type: use consistent line heights and vertical margins and paddings

Improve Visual Flow
- Use the direction of images to control the the speed and direction of flow
- Create barriers when you want to reverse the eyes direction
- Create open paths to allow easy movement through your design
- Use contrasting colors and shapes to pull the eye


### Unity

Unity is a measure of how well the elements on the page belong together. Through unity a viewer should first see the whole and then the sum of the parts making that whole.

Creating unity is similar to branding. You first establish what the design will be about, what the brand will stand for, and with that in mind create elements or make public statements that reinforce the design or brand. Think consistency around a central message.


### Dominance: Creating Focal Points In Your Design

When you create dominance in your work you are creating elements that command attention and prevail over other elements.

Every design should have a primary area of interest or focal point that serves as a way into the design. From the primary dominant element, design flow can be achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance.

Dominance:
- Relies on contrast
- Is the varying degree of emphasis in your design elements
- Creates a visual hierarchy in your design: use dominance to create an entry point into your design as well as a hierarchy to help guide the eye from one part of your design to the next
- More visual weight = more dominance in the element

A lack of dominance:
- Between elements leads to competition between them
- Your readers must work to find their own entry point into your design. That’s not as easy as it seems and the least amount of work may be moving on to another design on another page on another site. Remember, “Don’t make me think.” Instead make it easy to find a way into your design.

3 levels of dominance in your work:
1. Dominant: The element given the most visual weight, the element of primary emphasis. The dominant element will advance into the foreground in your composition.
2. Sub-Dominant: The element(s) of secondary emphasis that will become the middle ground in your composition.
3. Subordinate: The elements with tertiary emphasis, given the least visual weight. Subordinate elements will recede into the background of your composition.

Visual weight can be added/removed to elements through a combination of:
- Size: As you would expect larger elements carry more weight
- Color: It’s not fully understood why, but some colors are perceived as weighing more than others. Red seems to be heaviest while yellow seems to be lightest.
- Density: Packing more elements into a given space, gives more weight to that space.
- Value: A darker object will have more weight than a lighter object.
- Whitespace: Positive space weighs more than negative space or whitespace.
