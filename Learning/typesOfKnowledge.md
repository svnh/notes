The 6 Types Of Knowledge: From A Priori To Procedural

1. A Priori: knowledge depends upon what a person can derive from the world without needing to experience it.
1. A Posteriori: knowledge gained by first having an experience (and the important idea in philosophy is that it is acquired through the five senses) and then using logic and reflection to derive understanding from it.
1. Explicit: Explicit knowledge is knowledge that is recorded and communicated through mediums (knowledge stored in books), can be easily and quickly transmitted from one individual to another, or to another ten-thousand or ten-billion. It also tends to be organized systematically.
1. Tacit: It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to communicate tacit knowledge through any medium, can only be achieved through experience.
1. Propositional (declarative):knowledge that can literally be expressed in propositions; that is, in declarative sentences (to use its other name) or indicative propositions. Mathematical equations could be an example of propositional knowledge, because it is knowledge of something, as opposed to knowledge of how to do something.
1. Non-Propositional (procedural): knowledge that can be used; it can be applied to something, such as a problem. One of the defining characteristics of procedural knowledge is that it can be claimed in a court of law. In other words, companies that develop their own procedures or methods can protect them as intellectual property. They can then, of course, be sold, protected, leased, etc.
