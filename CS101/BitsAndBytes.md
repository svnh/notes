# Bits and Bytes

## Bit
- Smallest unit of storage
- Stores 0 or 1
- 8 bits is a a byte

## Byte
- One byte = grouping of 8 bits (e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0)
- Unit of information storage: 1 letter per byte
- Space that data takes up in the computer is measured in by the "byte"


Number of bits vs Distinct Patterns
- 1: 0 1
- 2: 00 01 10 11
- 3: 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

In general: add 1 bit, double the number of patterns
- 1 bit: 2 patterns
- 2 bits: 4
- 3 bits: 8
- 4 bits: 16
- 5 bits: 32
- 6 bits: 64
- 7 bits: 128
- 8 bits: 256
Mathematically: n bits yields 2‚Åø patterns (2 to the nth power)

Need to know:
- 1 byte is group of 8 bits
- One Byte, 8 bits, can make 256 different patterns
- To store a number in a byte: start with 0, go up, one pattern per number, until run out of patterns (256)
  - Code: pixel.setRed(n) took a number 0..255. Red value stored in one byte
- One byte holds a number 0..255

## Kilobyte or KB
- Kilobyte KB - about 1 thousand bytes
- A small email text is about 2 KB
- A 5 page paper might be 100 KB
- Text does not take a lot of bytes to store compared to images or video

## Megabyte or MB
- Megabyte (MB) - about 1 million bytes or 1000 KB
- MP3 audio is about 1 megabyte per minute
- A high quality digital picture is about 2-5 megabytes

## Gigabyte or GB
Gigabyte GB = about a billion bytes or about 1000 MB
- A DVD disk has a capacity 4.7GB (single layer) -- 2 GB per hour of video (varies greatly)
- A flash drive might hold 16 GB
- A hard drive might hold 750 GB

Terabyte or TB
- About 1000 gigabytes or roughly 1 trillion bytes
