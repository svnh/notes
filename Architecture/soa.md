Service:
- A self-contained unit of functionality
- Services can be combined to provide the functionality of a large software application

SOA:
- Architectural pattern where application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol
- A design concept that breaks down every application in modules ("service") that can be requested by a client application to fulfil a certain activity based on an input and optionally return a result
- SOA vs Monolith = potluck vs planned dinner party
